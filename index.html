        thomas is nine years old and lives in uganda. before his village had clean water, he and his siblings walked over two hours each day to collect water from a river that made them sick. today, thanks to supporters like you, a new well provides fresh, safe water just steps from his home. now thomas can go to school, dream bigger, and enjoy a healthier life â€” all because of clean water.
